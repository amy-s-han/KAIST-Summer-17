### Stashing some of the work I did over the summer here

### trails
- trail and report information from Washington Trail Association
- gathered using selenmium and stored in txt file

### yelp
- various scripts for gathering location information using bounding boxes and Yelp
- allQuadSearch.py: given a list of bounding boxes, search for each bounding box for a list of categories. Store results in txt and in database. Database ensures that there aren't duplicate entries. Compare quad tree bounding boxes with already searched bounding box to ensure there aren't duplicate searches in the same area.
